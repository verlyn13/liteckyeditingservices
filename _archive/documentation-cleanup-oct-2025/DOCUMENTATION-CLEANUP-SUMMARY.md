- ✅ Pre-commit hooks passed (package versions, repo structure)
- ✅ Repository structure validated
- ✅ No forbidden files detected

## 🎉 Results

### Before Cleanup
- 22 markdown files in root directory
- Mixed historical and current documentation
- Production URLs inconsistent (mix of preview and production)
- "DNS migration pending" messages throughout
- Orphaned test scripts in root
- 5 separate Cloudflare documentation files

### After Cleanup  
- 15 focused markdown files in root directory
- Clear separation: current docs in root, historical in archive
- All production URLs updated to liteckyeditingservices.com
- All "pending" statuses resolved
- Scripts properly organized
- Single consolidated Cloudflare reference

### Improvements
- **Discoverability**: Archive READMEs explain what's there and why
- **Accuracy**: All URLs and statuses reflect production reality
- **Organization**: Clear structure with logical grouping
- **Maintainability**: Reduced redundancy, single source of truth

## 📚 Documentation Accessibility

All documentation is now:
1. **Indexed** in DOCUMENTATION-MASTER-INDEX.md
2. **Up-to-date** with production status
3. **Organized** by purpose and chronology
4. **Discoverable** via README files in archives
5. **Consolidated** to reduce duplication

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

Documentation is now production-ready. Future maintenance:
1. Keep PROJECT-STATUS.md as single source of truth
2. Archive deployment artifacts to `_archive/migrations/YYYY-MM-DD-name/`
3. Update DOCUMENTATION-MASTER-INDEX.md when adding major docs
4. Preserve CLOUDFLARE.md as primary Cloudflare reference
5. Move any future setup guides to archive after completion
