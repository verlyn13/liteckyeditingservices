## Context

After completing the DNS migration (October 4) and Git-connected deployment (October 5), we needed to:
1. Update all production URLs from preview to custom domain
2. Archive completed migration documentation
3. Consolidate redundant Cloudflare setup guides
4. Move test scripts to proper locations
5. Update master index and status documents

## Subsequent Updates

A second documentation audit was performed on October 5, 2025, after:
- Git-connected deployment migration
- CSP security fix (data: URI support)
- Automated deployment workflows operational

All documentation now reflects the current production state with Git-connected deployments.
