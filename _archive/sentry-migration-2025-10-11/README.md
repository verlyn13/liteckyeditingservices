# Sentry Setup Migration Archive

This directory contains archived Sentry documentation from the initial integration (October 11, 2025).

## Archived Files

- **SENTRY-SETUP-COMPLETE.md** - Initial setup completion status document
  - Archived: October 12, 2025
  - Reason: Duplicate/overlapping content with main Sentry docs
  - Superseded by: docs/SENTRY-SETUP.md (comprehensive guide)

## Active Sentry Documentation

The current Sentry documentation structure is:
1. **docs/SENTRY-README.md** - Quick reference and getting started
2. **docs/SENTRY-SETUP.md** - Complete setup guide with all procedures
3. **docs/SENTRY-INTEGRATIONS.md** - Technical integration reference

## Migration Notes

The initial Sentry integration created multiple overlapping documents as the setup evolved. This archive preserves the historical completion status while the active docs provide ongoing reference.

- **sentry-setup-playbook.md** - Original operational playbook
  - Archived: October 12, 2025
  - Reason: Content consolidated into docs/SENTRY-SETUP.md Section 14
  - Superseded by: docs/SENTRY-SETUP.md (now includes operational procedures)
