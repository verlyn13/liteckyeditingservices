## Purpose

These documents capture state at a specific date but are not maintained going forward:
- CMS audits/tests from Oct 12
- Implementation plans/status from Oct 10-12

- CI toolchain status from Oct

The current state is documented in living documents that are actively maintained.

### Completed Work Logs
