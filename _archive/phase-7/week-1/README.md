# Phase 7 Week 1 - Historical Documentation

**Archived**: October 10, 2025
**Original Date**: October 4, 2025
**Status**: Week 1 Complete ✅

## Contents

This directory contains historical documentation from Phase 7 Week 1 implementation:

1. **PHASE-7-PROGRESS.md** (319 lines) - Real-time task tracking with timestamps
2. **PHASE-7-SESSION-SUMMARY.md** (479 lines) - Executive summary and deployment plan
3. **PHASE-7-CHECKPOINT.md** (292 lines) - Git checkpoint and validation checklist

## What Was Accomplished

### Week 1 Deliverables (100% Complete)

- ✅ Production E2E tests passing
- ✅ Security headers implementation (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
- ✅ Visual regression baselines (4 screenshots)
- ✅ Uptime monitoring documentation (UptimeRobot/Pingdom)
- ✅ Error alerting documentation (Cloudflare Workers)
- ✅ Queue health monitoring documentation

### Files Created/Modified

- 14 new files (tests, docs, configurations)
- 2 modified files (test fixes)
- Total deployment size: ~320KB

## Why This Was Archived

These three documents tracked the same work session from different angles, creating redundancy:

- All documented the same 6 completed tasks
- All referenced the same October 4, 2025 deployment
- All provided overlapping next steps for Week 2

The information has been preserved here for historical reference while the active documentation focuses on current status.
