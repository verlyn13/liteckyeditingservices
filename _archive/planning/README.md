- **Original location**: `/docs/next-steps-issues.md`
- **Date**: October 4, 2025
- **Purpose**: Backlog of tasks for Phase 7 Week 2 (Oct 4-18, 2025)
- **Status**: Tasks should be tracked in GitHub Issues, not markdown files

## Contents of Backlog

The backlog included tasks across 5 categories:

1. **Monitoring & Reliability** (3 tasks)
2. **Testing & Quality** (4 tasks)
3. **Performance** (4 tasks)
4. **Security** (3 tasks)
5. **SEO & Content** (3 tasks)
6. **Developer Experience** (3 tasks)

## Next Steps

- [ ] Create GitHub Issues from this backlog
- [ ] Organize issues with appropriate labels (monitoring, testing, performance, etc.)
- [ ] Add to project board for tracking
- [ ] Include Definition of Done for each issue

## Note

Going forward, use GitHub Issues/Projects for task management instead of markdown files. Markdown should be used for documentation, not ephemeral task tracking.
