    - Added admin area instrumentation in `public/admin/sentry-admin.js` for OAuth and CMS tracking
    - Created test page at `/test-sentry` with interactive buttons for errors, spans, and logs
    - Wrote 17 objective Playwright tests in `tests/sentry-integration.spec.ts`
    - Configured environment variables (PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN, PUBLIC_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT, PUBLIC_SENTRY_RELEASE)
    - Created three-tier documentation (SENTRY-README.md, SENTRY-SETUP.md, SENTRY-INTEGRATIONS.md)
    - Updated ENVIRONMENT.md with Sentry configuration section
    - Added Sentry to DOCUMENTATION-MASTER-INDEX.md with cross-references

  - ✅ **Sampling Rates**: Set to 10% transactions, 10% session replays, 100% error replays (free tier optimized)
  - ✅ **Admin Tracking**: Separate Sentry instance for admin area tracks OAuth login flow and CMS events

**Recent Progress - October 10, 2025**:
  - 🔧 **Acceptance Hardening**: String‑only callback message (canonical `authorization:github:success:`); callback retry tuning (10× @ 100ms).
  - 🔧 **Config Discovery Endpoint**: Added `/api/config.yml` (mirrors `/admin/config.yml`) and pointed admin `<link rel="cms-config-url">` to `/api/config.yml`. Set `auth_endpoint: api/auth` to mirror docs' append semantics.
  - 🔧 **Deep Diagnostics**: External diagnostics (no inline), storage write tracer, pre/post state sweeps, `window.open(/api/auth)` probe, `__dumpUser()` and `__forceAccept()` shim.
  - 🔧 **PKCE Wiring**: Added client PKCE helper (`pkce-login.js`), switched callback to post code-only, added `/api/exchange-token` to swap `{ code, verifier }` for `{ token }` server-side. `/api/auth` now honors `state` (and legacy `client_state`) and PKCE params.
  - ✅ **PKCE-Only Enforcement**: Capture-phase interception prevents Decap’s internal handler; single popup/name; re-entry guard; badge. Auth prefers client `state`; `/api/exchange-token` returns upstream error details. CI gate ensures exactly one self-hosted Decap bundle.
  - 🔁 **Back-compat Fallback**: During function rollout, admin sends both `state` and `client_state` to `/api/auth` to ensure compatibility with older deployments. This will be removed after propagation is confirmed.
  - 🛡️ **Open Intercept**: Admin now intercepts any programmatic `window.open('/api/auth')` and routes through the PKCE launcher to prevent competing Decap flows from generating a mismatched `state`.
  - 🚀 **Early Boot Shim**: Added `public/admin/pkce-boot.js` and loaded it before Decap so any references to `window.open` and `location.assign/replace` point to our wrappers. Real `window.open` is preserved as `__realWindowOpen` for our popup.
  - 🔒 **State-Gated Exchange**: Login script now exchanges codes only when `payload.state === sessionStorage['oauth_state']`, eliminating stray 400s from foreign flows.
  - ✅ **Single-Exchange + ACK**: Guard ensures only one code exchange runs; admin now stores popup ref and sends `authorization:ack` back to the callback to stop repeated code posts.
  - 🌐 **CORS Hardening**: `/api/exchange-token` now implements an `OPTIONS` handler and mirrors `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` on `POST` per Cloudflare Pages 2025 guidance to avoid silent preflight issues.
  - 🔁 **Token JSON Compatibility**: `/api/exchange-token` returns both `access_token` and `token` fields; admin accepts either and re-emits the canonical Decap token string to maximize compatibility across scripts.
  - 🔓 **Authorizer-Independent Flip**: On PKCE success, admin now writes the user to both `netlify-cms-user` and `decap-cms-user` in localStorage and dispatches legacy store actions when available; otherwise reloads to hydrate. This makes the UI flip reliable even with Decap’s authorizer disabled.
  - 🔁 **Server-side Exchange Primary**: `/api/callback` now exchanges `code+verifier` server-side using a short-lived cookie, posts `{ token, state }` to opener, and clears cookies; admin handles token messages directly and reloads after dispatch to ensure UI flip. Falls back to client exchange only if needed.
  - 🧩 **PKCE Acceptance Tweak** (Oct 11): Persist user with `login: "github"`, clear PKCE temp state, and hard-navigate to `/admin/#/` via `location.replace` after (optional) dispatch. This forces a clean Decap boot that reliably hydrates the stored user.
  - 🛠️ **Post-Boot Hydrator** (Oct 11): Added `public/admin/post-boot-hydrator.js` which, after navigation to `/admin/#/`, guarantees Decap hydration if LS already contains a user. It waits for the store, re-emits the canonical token message, manually dispatches as a fallback, and finally performs a one-time soft reload. All steps emit Sentry breadcrumbs (`hydr:*`) and capture exceptions with context. Admin HTML now emits `admin:html-start` and diagnostics logs `admin:diagnostics-loaded` for traceability.
  - 🚀 **Cache Bust + Rescue** (Oct 11): Versioned admin scripts (`pkce-login.v3.js`, `diagnostics.v2.js`) and added `public/_headers` with `Cache-Control: no-store` for `/admin/*` to defeat CDN/browser cache. Diagnostics includes a temporary rescue that seeds a user on token receipt if LS is empty, then navigates to `/#/`.
  - 🔐 **CSP + Sentry Fixes** (Oct 11): Removed inline scripts in `public/admin/index.html` to satisfy CSP; added `public/admin/html-start.js` for the early breadcrumb. Replaced ESM `sentry-admin.js` with a classic IIFE (no `import.meta`), loaded via `<script defer>` to avoid module/inline CSP issues. The admin Sentry initializer now reads config from `<meta name="sentry-*">` or `window.SENTRY_*` if present and exposes `window.__sentry` for other admin scripts.
  - 🧰 **Robust Acceptance Helper** (Oct 11): Added `admin/accept-login.js` with structured logs, idempotent guard, dispatch attempt, hard navigation, and post-nav verification. `pkce-login.v3` prefers `window.__acceptAndFlipFromToken` when present.
  - 🔧 **Token Exchange Fix**: `/api/exchange-token` now uses `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` for GitHub’s token endpoint (JSON body returned 400).
  - 🧩 **Admin Script Order** (Oct 11): Admin now loads `diagnostics.js`, `pkce-boot.js`, and `pkce-login.js` before the single self-hosted Decap bundle to ensure interceptors and acceptance logic are active at boot.
  - 🔧 **Media Paths Sanity**: Repo-side check + CI step for `public/uploads` and config values.
  - 🚚 **Decap Delivery Switched (Oct 11)**: Replaced vendor bundle with npm-delivered `decap-cms-app`. Admin now loads `/admin/cms.js` built via esbuild (`scripts/build-cms.mjs`). CSP remains scoped to `/admin/*`. Post-boot hydrator retained temporarily; remove after confirming stable hydration.
  - 🔐 **Secrets Orchestration (Infisical)**: Scripts added for prod SoT (`infisical_seed_prod_from_gopass.sh`, `infisical_pull_prod.sh`, `cloudflare_prepare_from_infisical.sh`), with Quickstart doc. Next step: CI workflow to export from Infisical and sync to Cloudflare Pages/Workers.
  - 🧹 **Admin Bundle Stabilization** (Oct 11): Admin now uses a single first‑party bundle `/admin/cms.js` built from `decap-cms-app`. Purge `/admin/*` on CDN after deploy to avoid stale caches.
  - 🛡️ **Admin CSP** (Oct 11): Added scoped CSP for `/admin/*` in `public/_headers` allowing only required hosts: GitHub APIs, Cloudflare Turnstile, and optional Sentry CDN; removed inline scripts to comply.

**Recent Progress - October 9, 2025**:
  - ✅ **Admin on Static HTML**: Decap CMS admin served via `public/admin/index.html` with single bundle + auto-init
    - Archived previous Astro admin and runtime boot scripts to `_archive/admin-migration-2025-10-09/`
    - Config served dynamically at `/admin/config.yml` with `base_url` and `auth_endpoint`
    - **Why**: Eliminates React double-mount/"removeChild" errors from multiple init paths; follows Decap install docs (static HTML, single bundle, auto-init from config link)
    - **Spec compliance**: Auto-init mode only (no `CMS.init()`), config discovery via `<link type="text/yaml" rel="cms-config-url">`
    - **Local testing**: `pnpm build && npx wrangler pages dev` serves localhost:8788 with admin + Pages Functions on one origin
  - ✅ **OAuth Debug Logging**: Added inline debug listener in `public/admin/index.html` (hash-allowed by CSP) to monitor postMessage events during OAuth flow
    - Logs auth-related messages (string/object) and origin
    - Loaded before Decap bundle for early listener attachment
    - Aids troubleshooting of popup → opener token handoff
  - ✅ **Documentation Alignment Audit**: Completed comprehensive docs-to-code alignment across 14 files (ARCHITECTURE.md, CLOUDFLARE.md, DEPLOYMENT.md, ENVIRONMENT.md, and all migration/config docs)
  - ✅ **Decap Spec Compliance**: Created comprehensive `docs/DECAP-SPEC-COMPLIANCE.md` with migration notes, verification commands, and 2025 best practices
  - ✅ **SendGrid Standardization**: Unified variable naming to `SENDGRID_FROM` across all docs and scripts; documented DNS verification procedures
  - ✅ **pnpm Version Pin**: Fixed `.mise.toml` to pin exact pnpm 10.17.1 (was "latest")
  - ✅ **Pages Subdomain Canonicalization**: Fixed all references from `litecky-editing-services.pages.dev` to `liteckyeditingservices.pages.dev`
  - ✅ **OAuth Architecture Documentation**: Marked external OAuth worker as legacy (decommissioned Oct 2025); documented on-site Pages Functions as current implementation
  - ✅ **On-Site OAuth Migration**: Migrated Decap CMS OAuth from external Cloudflare Worker to same-domain Pages Functions (`/api/auth`, `/api/callback`)
  - ✅ **Environment Variables Audit**: Consolidated all secrets/env vars documentation; created comprehensive `docs/ENVIRONMENT-AUDIT.md`
  - ✅ **Project Name Correction**: Fixed incorrect project name (`litecky-editing-services` → `liteckyeditingservices`) across all documentation and scripts
  - ✅ **Config Loading Fix**: Updated Decap CMS boot script to explicitly load config from `/admin/config.yml` (fixes dev/preview 404)
  - ✅ **Credentials Setup**: Set `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` in Cloudflare Pages production environment
  - ✅ **Code Quality**: Applied Biome linter fixes across OAuth functions and admin scripts

**Recent Progress - October 8, 2025**:
  - ✅ **Hardened OAuth Popup Handoff**: Implemented October 2025 best practices for reliable Decap CMS authentication
  - ✅ **Canonical Origin**: Added `public/_redirects` to redirect apex → www (301) for consistent OAuth flow
  - ✅ **CSP Hash for Inline Debug**: Admin CSP includes a script hash to allow the small inline debug listener; Decap bundle remains self-hosted
  - 🔧 **Admin Diagnostics CSP Fix** (Oct 10): Externalized inline diagnostics to `/admin/diagnostics.js` (no inline script required); avoids CSP hash drift while preserving strict admin CSP.
  - 🔧 **Deep Diagnostics** (Oct 10): Added storage write tracer, state sweeps, `window.open(/api/auth)` probe and `__forceAccept()` shim to pinpoint state handling and unblock acceptance if Decap didn't write state.
  - ✅ **COOP Headers**: Set `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: unsafe-none` on admin + OAuth worker endpoints
  - ✅ **Enhanced Security Headers**: Added X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy to admin
  - ✅ **CI Header Validation**: Post-deploy workflow now enforces COOP/COEP/CSP requirements
  - ✅ **Playwright Admin Tests**: Added synthetic tests for editor UI appearance and header verification
  - ✅ **Worker Updates**: Deployed OAuth worker with COOP headers; updated wrangler to 4.42.1
  - ✅ **Pages Function Fix**: Removed /* wildcard from _headers; used official Cloudflare PagesFunction types
  - ✅ **OAuth Complete** (CRITICAL): Fixed Decap CMS authentication with proper state handling; worker now accepts state from Decap instead of generating own; added 100ms delay to prevent race condition; state validation now passes and token is accepted; OAuth flow fully functional with same-origin callback, CSP script hash, and timing safeguards

**Recent Progress - October 7, 2025**:
  - ✅ **CSP Fix (Pages Function)**: Created `functions/admin/[[path]].ts` to set single authoritative CSP for /admin/* routes
  - ✅ **Header Merging Resolved**: Eliminated duplicate CSP headers by using Cloudflare Pages Function instead of _headers file
  - ✅ **October 2025 Best Practice**: Implemented programmatic header control for complex CSP scenarios
  - 🚧 **In Progress**: Migrating Decap OAuth from external Worker to on-site Cloudflare Pages Functions (`/api/auth`, `/api/callback`) to simplify origins and harden popup handoff
  - 🔧 **Dev UX**: Added `<link rel="cms-config-url" href="/admin/config.yml">` to ensure Decap loads config.yml correctly in dev/preview
  - 🔧 **Dev UX**: Guarded admin boot loader to prevent duplicate Decap initialization under HMR (avoids React removeChild errors)
  - 🔧 **OAuth State Echo**: /api/auth now honors Decap-provided `state` and opener origin; /api/callback posts Decap-compatible payload including `token_type:"bearer"` and `state` (string + object formats) with robust resend loop and ACK; opener origin cookie fallback added
  - 🔧 **Same-Origin Config**: `public/admin/config.yml` simplified to `auth_endpoint: /api/auth` (no `base_url`) for seamless local (wrangler pages dev) and production behavior
  - 🔧 **Admin Boot**: Removed explicit `CMS.init` call; Decap auto-initializes from `<link rel="cms-config-url">` to avoid double render and React removeChild errors
  - ✅ **OAuth Origin + Headers**: On-site Pages Functions (`/api/auth`, `/api/callback`) set COOP/CSP and post back to the opener origin with Decap‑compatible payloads; fixes "Authenticated successfully" but no editor UI.
  - 🔧 **Acceptance Hardening** (Oct 10): Switched callback to string‑only `authorization:github:success:` postMessage for maximum Decap compatibility, and enhanced admin diagnostics to compare localStorage state with message state.
  - 🔧 **Config Discovery Endpoint** (Oct 10): Added `/api/config.yml` (mirrors `/admin/config.yml`) and pointed admin `<link rel="cms-config-url">` to `/api/config.yml`. Set `auth_endpoint: api/auth` (no leading slash) to mirror docs' append semantics.
  - 🔧 **Media Paths Sanity** (Oct 10): Added repo-side check `tests/media-paths-check.mjs` and run it in post-deploy CI.
  - 🔧 **Callback Retry Tuning** (Oct 10): Post message every 100ms up to 10 tries, then auto-close.

### Phase 4: DNS Migration 🔄

#### 4.1 Prepare DNS Records

Current DNS (Google Sites):
```
liteckyeditingservices.com  CNAME  ghs.googlehosted.com
```

New DNS (Cloudflare Pages):
```
liteckyeditingservices.com      A      192.0.2.1  (Cloudflare Pages IP)
www.liteckyeditingservices.com  CNAME  liteckyeditingservices.pages.dev
```

SendGrid DNS Records (for domain authentication):
```
em._domainkey.liteckyeditingservices.com  CNAME  <sendgrid-value>
s1._domainkey.liteckyeditingservices.com  CNAME  <sendgrid-value>
s2._domainkey.liteckyeditingservices.com  CNAME  <sendgrid-value>
```

#### 4.2 Execute Migration

```bash
# Verify current DNS
fish scripts/cloudflare-audit.fish

# Plan DNS changes
fish scripts/cf-dns-manage.fish

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES

### Minor (Non-blocking):

1. **TypeScript Warnings** (build passes):
   - Unused variables in validation scripts
   - `is:inline` directive hints in Astro scripts
   - These are warnings only, not errors

2. **Content Placeholders**:
   - Some pages have placeholder content
   - Can be updated via CMS after deployment

3. **Wrangler CLI Path**:
   - Wrangler not in system PATH
   - Use `pnpm wrangler` instead of `wrangler`

### None Critical:
No critical bugs or blockers identified.
