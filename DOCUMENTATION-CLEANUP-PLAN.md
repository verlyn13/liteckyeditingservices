# Documentation Cleanup Plan
**Date**: October 4, 2025
**Reason**: DNS migration complete, production live, consolidate documentation

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Update all production URLs (DNS migration complete)
2. Archive completed migration documentation
3. Consolidate redundant Cloudflare deployment docs
4. Move orphaned test scripts to proper locations
5. Update master index and project status
6. Ensure all documentation is discoverable and accurate

## 📋 Actions

### Phase 1: Archive Completed Migration Docs
**Move to `_archive/migrations/`**:
- [x] DNS-ANALYSIS.md (migration complete)
- [x] DNS-MIGRATION-GUIDE.md (migration complete)
- [x] DEPLOYMENT-SUMMARY-2025-10-02.md (historical record)
- [x] POST-DEPLOYMENT-VALIDATION-2025-10-02.md (historical record)

### Phase 2: Update Production URLs
**Files to update** (preview → production domain):
- [x] README.md - Update production URL and status
- [x] PROJECT-STATUS.md - Mark DNS migration complete
- [x] DEPLOYMENT.md - Update production URL
- [ ] DOCUMENTATION-MASTER-INDEX.md - Update status

### Phase 3: Consolidate Cloudflare Documentation
**Current files** (assess for consolidation):
- CLOUDFLARE-DEPLOYMENT-DIRECTIVE.md (6.1K)
- CLOUDFLARE-DEPLOYMENT-WORKFLOW.md (9.2K)
- CLOUDFLARE-DOCUMENTATION-SUMMARY.md (5.1K)
- CLOUDFLARE-REQUIREMENTS.md (9.6K)
- CLOUDFLARE-WORKERS-SETUP.md (6.5K)

**Action**: Review and consolidate into:
- CLOUDFLARE-GUIDE.md (comprehensive guide)
- Archive redundant/outdated versions

### Phase 4: Organize Test Scripts
**Move root scripts to appropriate locations**:
- [x] check-sendgrid-activity.mjs → scripts/
- [x] check-sendgrid-status.mjs → scripts/
- [x] final-email-test.mjs → tests/

### Phase 5: Update Master Documentation
