quote: Ahnie Litecky Editing Services was professional, fast, and streamlined
  from start to finish! She was enthusiastic about my topic and in touch with
  the depth psychological undertone of my thesis project.  In my Acknowledgments
  section, I called her "whip-quick." I feel lucky that she answered my inquiry
  before any other prospective editors responded and that speed proved to be her
  trademark. Thank you, Ahnie!
