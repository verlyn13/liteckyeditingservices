## üöÄ Recent Accomplishments (October 12, 2025)

### Phase 1: CI/CD Pipeline Enhancements ‚úÖ

**Performance Improvements (~40% faster)**:
- **Preflight Job**: Repository secrets/variables verification before workflow execution
- **Caching Strategy**: pnpm store + Playwright browsers intelligently cached
- **Concurrency Controls**: Duplicate PR runs automatically cancelled
- **Wrangler Pinning**: v4.40.3 locked to prevent unexpected breaking changes
- **Sourcemap Verification**: Automated checks ensure Sentry error tracking works

### Phase 2: Sentry Integration ‚úÖ

**Complete Error Monitoring Solution**:
- Sourcemaps enabled in Vite build configuration
- Enhanced middleware with automatic PII scrubbing
- Environment-based sampling (10% prod, 100% dev/preview)
- Production-only HSTS headers
- Release tracking using commit SHA
- Privacy-first configuration with sensitive data filtering

### Phase 3: Biome v2.2.5 Migration ‚úÖ

**Modern Linting & Formatting**:
- Biome pinned to v2.2.5 for stability
- Optimized configuration preventing directory crawl hangs
- Prettier/Biome overlap eliminated
- CI reporters configured (compact, github, summary)
- VCS integration enabled
- Performance validated (<10s typical runs)
