## 🎓 Key Insights from Documentation Review

1. **Documentation.md is the blueprint** - It provides complete templates for all user-facing docs
2. **Monorepo structure required** - Cloudflare deployment expects apps/, workers/, packages/
3. **Secret management is complex** - Requires gopass/age/mise setup
4. **Quality tools are extensive** - Biome v2 + ESLint 9 + Prettier + Husky
5. **Memory Bank system** - AI assistant configuration for different modes
6. **Policy as Code** - OPA/Rego for governance (advanced feature)
